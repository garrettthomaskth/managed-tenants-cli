```

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

## Develop

Install `pre-commit` hooks:
```bash
$ pre-commit install
```

Install the development requirements:

```bash
$ make develop
```

Run the code checks:

```bash
$ make check
```

Run the tests:

```bash
$ make test

## Release

Update the VERSION file to reflect the new version. Submit a pull request and merge it to main. Once it is merged, you need to create a new tag and a new release. You can do this by clicking "Draft a new release" on the Releases page and then creating a new tag instead of selecting one from the dropdown. Please also use the option to "Generate release notes". After that, a CI job will be triggered that will publish the package on PyPI.


Alternatively, you can create a new tag by running:
```
git checkout main && git pull upstream main
git tag X.Y.Z
git push upstream X.Y.Z
```
and then draft the release in the web UI.
